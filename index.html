    Insert the information in the form and the calculator will determine the cash ratio<br> 
    What is the cash ratio?<br>
    The cash ratio is a measurement of the firm's liquidity. It measures the ratio of a firm's total cash and cash equivalents to it's current liabilites.<br>
    How to calculate cash ratio?<br>
    To calculate cash ratio you should use the following formula:<br>
    cash ratio = (cash + cash equivalent) / total current liabilities<br>
    Example: Company x has $35,000,000 in cash, $12,000,000 worth of cash equivalent and it also has $70,000,000 in total current liabilities, calculate the cash ratio?<br>
    Using the cash ratio formula the answer will be:<br>
    cash ratio = (cash + cash equivalent) / total current liabilities<br>
    cash ratio = ($35,000,000 + $12,000,000) / $70,000,000<br>
    cash ratio = 0.67<br>
    Why use cash ratio?<br>
    The cash ratio is used to measure the firm's liquidity. It is also used to measure the firm's ability to pay it's short term debt with cash or cash equivalents and this measurement is really imporant because ith helps them to  decide the acmount of money they should loan the firm.<br>
